# Blue Sea Captain

## Project Overview

Blue Sea Captain is a multi-phase mobile application developed to modernize and streamline cruise booking and management for Blue Sea Company, which operates daily voyages between major cities worldwide. This project demonstrates my skills in app architecture, user authentication, real-time data management, and geolocation services, leveraging Firebase and Google APIs to deliver an intuitive user experience.

## Project Objectives

Building upon advanced concepts in multi-application integration and backend connectivity, this project applies lessons learned about cross-app communication and cloud backend services (Firebase) to solve real-world problems in the tourism and travel sector. The goal is to empower both customers and company administrators with seamless tools for voyage scheduling, management, and tracking.

## Project Requirements and Implementation
